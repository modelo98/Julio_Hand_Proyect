## ðŸ¦¾ Version 5 â€“ Finger C
In this version, the construction of the **articulated arm** that connects to the **fingertip (distal phalanx)** has begun.  
Each finger uses **two motors** to flex and extend the **MP** and **PIP joints**.  
However, to **save space** in the forearm â€” where the motors will be placed â€” and to **simplify the mechanism**, the **DIP joint** is designed to move through a **mechanical linkage** driven by the motion of the **PIP joint**. This will be well illustrated in future versions.
